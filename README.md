# TicTacToe
The infamous TicTacToe Project that everyone knew and played atleast one time in their life. The project was made in C++ by using simple loops and conditional statements. Currently the project can be played by 2 players (1 vs 1). I am working on the AI so that we can be able to play with the computer.

it is open for anyone who wants to change and optimize the code.
